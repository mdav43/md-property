Buying your first home is one of life's biggest milestones, and doing it on the Sunshine Coast adds an extra layer of excitement—and complexity. With over 20 years of experience guiding buyers through property purchases, I've compiled my top tips to help first-timers navigate this journey with confidence.

## 1. Get Your Finances in Order Early

Before you start browsing properties or attending open homes, you need to understand your financial position. This is non-negotiable.

### What You Should Do:

- **Get pre-approval from a lender** - This tells you exactly how much you can borrow
- **Save for a deposit** - Aim for at least 20% to avoid lender's mortgage insurance
- **Budget for additional costs** - Factor in stamp duty, legal fees, building inspections, and moving costs
- **Review your credit score** - Address any issues before applying for a loan

Having your finances sorted not only helps you search within your price range but also shows sellers you're a serious buyer when you make an offer.

## 2. Research the Market and Understand Value

The Sunshine Coast is diverse, with different areas offering different lifestyles and price points. What works for a young professional might not suit a growing family.

### Key Areas to Research:

- **Mooloolaba** - Established beachside living with strong community feel
- **Maroochydore** - Transforming with the new CBD development
- **Caloundra** - Family-friendly with excellent schools and beaches
- **Kawana Waters** - Modern facilities and good value for money
- **Buderim** - Elevated living with village charm

Spend time in different neighborhoods. Visit on weekdays and weekends. Talk to locals. Understand commute times if you're working. Research school zones if you have children.

## 3. Don't Skip the Building and Pest Inspection

I cannot stress this enough: **always** get a professional building and pest inspection before committing to a purchase.

### Why This Matters:

A property might look perfect on the surface, but hidden issues can cost you tens of thousands to repair. A comprehensive inspection can reveal:

- Structural problems
- Termite damage
- Electrical or plumbing issues
- Water damage or moisture problems
- Asbestos (in older properties)

Yes, inspections cost money (typically $400-600), but they can save you from making a costly mistake. If issues are found, you can either negotiate repairs, adjust your offer, or walk away.

## 4. Be Prepared to Move Quickly (But Not Recklessly)

The Sunshine Coast market can move fast, especially for well-priced properties in desirable areas. However, being prepared doesn't mean being reckless.

### Strike the Right Balance:

**Be Ready:**
- Have your pre-approval in hand
- Know your absolute maximum price
- Be prepared to make decisions within 24-48 hours

**Stay Cautious:**
- Don't let auction fever or fear of missing out push you over budget
- Take time to review building inspections carefully
- Consult with your advocate or agent before making final decisions

Remember: another property will always come along, but financial stress from over-extending yourself can last years.

## 5. Work With a Buyer's Advocate

As a first-time buyer, you're navigating unfamiliar territory. A buyer's advocate levels the playing field.

### What a Buyer's Advocate Does:

- Helps you identify properties that match your criteria (including off-market opportunities)
- Conducts due diligence on properties
- Negotiates on your behalf
- Guides you through contracts and legalities
- Provides objective advice when emotions run high

Think of it this way: sellers have agents representing their interests. Why shouldn't you have someone representing yours?

## Bonus Tip: Think Long-Term

Your first home doesn't have to be your forever home, but you should still think about resale value and long-term livability.

Consider:
- Is the area growing or stagnating?
- Are there infrastructure projects that will enhance the area?
- Does the property have broad appeal for future buyers?
- Can you see yourself living here for at least 5-7 years?
