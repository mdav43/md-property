When people ask me about the Sunshine Coast property market, I don't rely on gut feelings or anecdotes. I rely on data. Let's dive deep into the numbers that tell the story of why the Sunshine Coast is positioned for continued growth in 2026 and beyond.

## Population Growth: The Foundation

The most fundamental driver of property demand is population growth, and the Sunshine Coast is experiencing significant demographic shifts.

### Key Statistics:

- **5-Year Growth Rate**: 2.1% annually (compared to national average of 1.4%)
- **Interstate Migration**: 12,000+ net arrivals in the past year
- **Age Demographics**: 35-54 age group growing fastest (prime property-buying years)
- **Projected Growth**: Population expected to reach 450,000 by 2031

**What This Means**: More people need places to live. As long as supply remains constrained, prices will face upward pressure.

## Economic Indicators

The Sunshine Coast economy has diversified significantly, moving beyond tourism to become a genuine economic hub.

### Employment Growth

- **Job Growth**: 3.2% annually over the past 5 years
- **Key Sectors**: Health care, education, professional services, construction
- **Maroochydore CBD**: Expected to create 15,000+ jobs over the next decade
- **Remote Work**: 40% of professionals now work remotely or in hybrid arrangements

**Why It Matters**: Economic opportunity drives population growth and supports property values.

## Infrastructure Investment

Public and private infrastructure spending is transforming the region.

### Major Projects:

**Sunshine Coast Airport Expansion**
- $450 million investment

## Supply and Demand Dynamics

Understanding the balance between supply and demand is crucial for predicting market direction.

### Current Market Conditions:

**Supply Side:**
- Building approvals down 15% from peak
- Limited land availability in coastal areas
- Development constraints in established suburbs
- Construction costs remain elevated

**Demand Side:**
- Interstate migration continues strong
- Local upgraders active in the market
- Investment buyers attracted by rental yields (4-5%)
- First-home buyers benefiting from regional incentives

**The Imbalance**: Demand consistently outstrips supply, particularly in the $700,000-$1.5 million range.

## Price Performance Analysis

Let's look at actual price movements across different segments:

### Median Price Trends (5-Year):

**Houses:**
- Mooloolaba: +48% ($1.1M → $1.63M)

When comparing median house prices to median household income:
- Sunshine Coast: 7.5x (better than Sydney's 12x, Melbourne's 10x)
- Brisbane: 7.2x
- Gold Coast: 8.1x

**The Sweet Spot**: The Sunshine Coast offers strong growth potential with relatively better affordability than Sydney or Melbourne.
