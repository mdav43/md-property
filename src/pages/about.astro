          <h2>A Journey of Excellence</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Jack McGhee, a senior real estate professional with over 20 years of experience 
            delivering premium results in Sydney's most competitive property markets. My career has 
            spanned the Inner City through to the Eastern Beaches, where I've consistently achieved 
            record prices by combining disciplined strategy with decisive negotiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach is grounded in understanding buyer behaviour—how people make decisions, 
            what creates urgency, and how to position a property to maximise perceived value. I pair 
            this with clear communication, deep market knowledge, and a calm, down-to-earth style that 
            keeps my clients informed, confident, and in control throughout the process.
          </p>

      <h2>From Sydney to the Sunshine Coast</h2>
      <p>
        After relocating to the Sunshine Coast with my young family, I'm now proud to call 
        Mooloolaba home and bring metropolitan expertise to a community I've long admired. My focus 
        is simple: reduce uncertainty, protect your property's value, and deliver results that 
        exceed expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        12 months ago, I settled in Mooloolaba, turning my frequent visits to the Sunshine Coast 
        over the past 15 years into a permanent lifestyle. With strong family ties in Buderim and 
        Mooloolaba, I bring a personal passion for the area alongside my professional expertise 
        honed in Sydney's competitive eastern suburbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sunshine Coast isn't just where I work—it's the place I call home. Let me help you make 
        this stunning region your home too.

        <h3>Selling Your Property</h3>
        <h5>The Power of Emotional Connection</h5>
        <p>
          Australians are motivated by the lifestyle a property offers. My marketing strategies tap 
          into these motivations using tailored storytelling, evocative imagery, and immersive 
          campaigns that make buyers see themselves living in your home.

        <p>
          Maximizing value requires deep market knowledge and strategic insight. I use data-driven 
          approaches to position your property competitively while my negotiation skills ensure you 
          secure the best possible price.
