Buying your first home is one of life's most significant financial decisions. It's exciting, sometimes overwhelming, but ultimately incredibly rewarding. Having guided hundreds of first-time buyers through the process, I've compiled the essential advice that makes the difference between a stressful experience and a seamless one.

## 1. Get Your Finance Sorted First

This cannot be stressed enough: before you start looking at properties, get pre-approval from a lender. Not a rough estimate or an online calculator result—actual pre-approval.

Why this matters:

- You'll know exactly what you can afford, preventing disappointment
- Sellers and agents take you seriously when making an offer
- In competitive situations, pre-approval can be the difference between securing the property or missing out
- You'll understand your true budget including stamp duty, legal fees, and moving costs

Work with a mortgage broker who can shop around for the best rates. The savings over the life of your loan can be substantial.

## 2. Understand the True Cost of Homeownership

Your mortgage payment is just the beginning. First-time buyers often underestimate the ongoing costs of property ownership:

- Council rates and water charges
- Building and contents insurance
- Maintenance and repairs (budget 1-2% of property value annually)
- Body corporate fees for apartments
- Utilities and services

Create a realistic budget that accounts for these expenses. The last thing you want is to be "house poor"—owning a beautiful property but struggling to maintain it or enjoy life.

## 3. Location, Location, Location (But Not How You Think)

Everyone knows location matters, but first-time buyers often focus on the wrong factors. Consider:

### Infrastructure and Development

Look at planned infrastructure projects. The new Maroochydore CBD, for example, is transforming the region. Properties near major developments often appreciate faster.

### Commute and Lifestyle

Don't just think about today—consider your five-year plan. Will the location still work if you change jobs, have children, or your lifestyle evolves?

### Resale Potential

Even if this is your "forever home," circumstances change. Properties near good schools, public transport, and amenities are always easier to sell.

## 4. Don't Skip the Building and Pest Inspection

I've seen too many first-time buyers skip inspections to save a few hundred dollars, only to discover tens of thousands in hidden issues after settlement.

A comprehensive building and pest inspection is non-negotiable. The inspection might reveal:

- Structural issues that affect safety and value
- Termite damage requiring expensive treatment
- Plumbing or electrical problems
- Issues you can negotiate on price or repairs before finalizing the purchase

Think of the inspection fee as insurance. It's a small price to pay for peace of mind and protection against nasty surprises.

## 5. Work with a Buyer's Advocate

As a first-time buyer, you're entering a complex market where everyone else has more experience than you. Sellers have agents representing their interests—why shouldn't you?

A buyer's advocate brings:

- Deep market knowledge to identify fair value
- Access to off-market properties you'd never find on your own
- Negotiation expertise that often pays for the service many times over
- Objective advice when emotions run high
- Understanding of contracts, conditions, and legal protections

The Sunshine Coast market can be competitive, especially in desirable areas like Mooloolaba and Noosa. Having someone in your corner who knows the market intimately is invaluable.

## Bonus Tip: Take Your Time

Fear of missing out (FOMO) drives many first-time buyers to rush decisions they later regret. Yes, the right property can sell quickly, but there are always more properties. Don't let anyone pressure you into a decision that doesn't feel right.

Visit properties multiple times, at different times of day. Talk to neighbors. Research the area thoroughly. The goal isn't just to buy a property—it's to find the right home for your lifestyle and future.

## Your First Home Journey

Buying your first home on the Sunshine Coast should be an exciting milestone, not a stressful ordeal. By getting your finances organized, understanding the true costs, choosing the right location, protecting yourself with inspections, and working with experienced professionals, you'll navigate the process with confidence.

Remember: everyone who owns a home was once a first-time buyer. With the right preparation and guidance, you'll look back on this time fondly as the beginning of your property journey.
