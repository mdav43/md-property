_December 2025 | By Jack McGhee | 5 min read_

As we enter 2026, the Sunshine Coast continues to establish itself as one of Australia's most dynamic and sought-after property markets. The combination of lifestyle appeal, infrastructure investment, and demographic shifts creates a compelling narrative for both buyers and sellers.

## Market Fundamentals Remain Strong

The Sunshine Coast property market has demonstrated remarkable resilience over the past few years. Despite broader economic headwinds, the region continues to attract buyers from metropolitan areas, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, seeking a lifestyle upgrade without sacrificing career opportunities.

Key indicators suggest sustained demand through 2026:

- Continued strong population growth, particularly in the 30-50 age demographic
- Increasing infrastructure investment, including the Sunshine Coast Airport expansion
- Growing business sector with major companies establishing regional offices
- Limited supply of premium properties in desirable coastal locations

## The Work-From-Anywhere Effect

The normalisation of remote and hybrid work arrangements has fundamentally altered buyer priorities. No longer are professionals forced to choose between career and lifestyle. This shift has been particularly beneficial for the Sunshine Coast, offering the perfect blend of coastal living and connectivity.

We're seeing increased demand in areas like Mooloolaba, Maroochydore, and Noosa, where buyers can enjoy beachside living while maintaining their professional careers. This trend shows no signs of slowing in 2026.

## Investment Hotspots for 2026

Based on current trends and upcoming developments, several areas stand out for 2026:

### Maroochydore CBD

The ongoing development of the Maroochydore City Centre represents a once-in-a-generation transformation. As businesses move in and amenities expand, we expect to see continued appreciation in surrounding residential areas.

### Mooloolaba

Mooloolaba's established beachside charm combined with walkability and community infrastructure makes it a perennial favorite. Limited land availability keeps supply tight, supporting long-term value growth.

### Caloundra

Often overlooked in favor of its northern neighbors, Caloundra offers exceptional value for families and retirees. The area's beaches, schools, and community feel make it ripe for growth.

## What This Means for Sellers

If you're considering selling in 2026, timing remains favorable. However, the market has evolved from the frenetic pace of recent years to a more considered environment. This means:

- Presentation matters more than ever—buyers have options and expect quality
- Strategic pricing is crucial; overpricing can result in extended selling periods
- Marketing needs to tell a lifestyle story, not just showcase features
- Professional guidance is essential to navigate the nuanced market conditions

## Advice for Buyers

For buyers, 2026 presents opportunities for those who move decisively. The market favors the prepared:

- Get pre-approval before you start searching—this is non-negotiable in competitive situations
- Work with an advocate who knows the local market intimately
- Look beyond the immediate property to future infrastructure and development
- Consider both lifestyle and investment fundamentals in your decision-making

## The Bottom Line

The Sunshine Coast property market enters 2026 from a position of strength. While we may not see the double-digit growth rates of recent years, steady appreciation backed by solid fundamentals makes this an attractive market for both buyers and sellers.

Success in this market comes down to understanding the nuances, timing your move appropriately, and working with professionals who have deep local knowledge. Whether you're buying your dream home or selling to capitalize on growth, 2026 offers opportunities for those who approach the market strategically.
