# About Jack McGhee

> *"Think you know property? You don't know Jack."*

## A Journey of Excellence

I'm Jack McGhee, a senior real estate professional with over 20 years of experience delivering premium results in Sydney's most competitive property markets. My career has spanned the Inner City through to the Eastern Beaches, where I've consistently achieved record prices by combining disciplined strategy with decisive negotiation.

My approach is grounded in understanding buyer behaviour—how people make decisions, what creates urgency, and how to position a property to maximise perceived value. I pair this with clear communication, deep market knowledge, and a calm, down-to-earth style that keeps my clients informed, confident, and in control throughout the process.

## From Sydney to the Sunshine Coast

After relocating to the Sunshine Coast with my young family, I'm now proud to call Mooloolaba home and bring metropolitan expertise to a community I've long admired. My focus is simple: reduce uncertainty, protect your property's value, and deliver results that exceed expectations.

12 months ago, I settled in Mooloolaba, turning my frequent visits to the Sunshine Coast over the past 15 years into a permanent lifestyle. With strong family ties in Buderim and Mooloolaba, I bring a personal passion for the area alongside my professional expertise honed in Sydney's competitive eastern suburbs.

The Sunshine Coast isn't just where I work—it's the place I call home. Let me help you make this stunning region your home too.
