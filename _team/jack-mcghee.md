I'm Jack McGhee, a senior real estate professional with over 20 years of experience delivering premium results in Sydney's most competitive property markets. After relocating to the Sunshine Coast with my young family, I'm now proud to call Mooloolaba home.

My approach is grounded in understanding buyer behaviour, clear communication, deep market knowledge, and a calm, down-to-earth style that keeps my clients informed and confident throughout the process.
