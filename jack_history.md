Revised Biography – First Person (Website Version)

I’m Jack McGhee, a senior real estate professional with over 20 years of experience delivering premium results in Sydney’s most competitive property markets. My career has spanned the Inner City through to the Eastern Beaches, where I’ve consistently achieved record prices by combining disciplined strategy with decisive negotiation.

My approach is grounded in understanding buyer behaviour—how people make decisions, what creates urgency, and how to position a property to maximise perceived value. I pair this with clear communication, deep market knowledge, and a calm, down-to-earth style that keeps my clients informed, confident, and in control throughout the process.

After relocating to the Sunshine Coast with my young family, I’m now proud to call Mooloolaba home and bring metropolitan expertise to a community I’ve long admired. My focus is simple: reduce uncertainty, protect your property’s value, and deliver results that exceed expectations.

Whether you’re buying, selling, or seeking honest market guidance, my goal is to provide a structured, transparent, and highly personalised real estate experience—making your next move both rewarding and seamless.
